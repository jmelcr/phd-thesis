Cellular membranes are important and evolutionarily very old biological structures. 
\citep{MolBiolCell} 
The first primitive predecessors of cells already bear hints of membranes 
separating their inner environment from the outer world. 
Current organisms often contain a multitude of immensly complex membranes, 
each serving many functions. 
\emph{Processes in cellular membranes} are crucial for life. 

%In this thesis,
%Simulation of processes in cellular membranes,
%I focus on the processes, 
My work is motivated by the processes,
which involve interactions of biologically relevant ions with membranes. 
Fusion of synaptic vesicles with neuronal cell membranes 
is controlled by a divalent cation \ce{Ca^{2+}}.
Excitable cells like neurons 
rely on the exchange of the monovalent cations \ce{Na^+} and \ce{K^+},
which form a variable transmembrane potential
enabling them to conduct electrical signals. 
The transmembrane potential can be modeled in atomistic simulations by two methods, 
the constant electric field method, 
and the ion-imbalance method. 
The methodological differences between them raise a few questions -- 
do they provide the same results? 
Can they be used interchangably?
What happens to the membrane under voltage?


In this work, 
I will also quantify the interactions of 
\ce{Na^+}, \ce{K^+} and \ce{Ca^{2+}} cations,
with model biological membranes
using classical molecular dynamics simulation. 
In order to achive this goal,
I developed an improved force field
of phospholipids as the major components of cellular membranes.
These new models account for electronic polarization
using the electronic continuum correction,  
which is an effective way of accounting for electronic polarization via charge rescaling. 
How crucial is the electronic polarization for the interaction of phospholipid bilayers with cations?
Is it only applicable to molecules?
Can we obtain realistic structures of phospholipid bilayers and cations at atomistic resolution?


%I will provide a proof of concept 
%for the applicability of this approach 
%to both neutral and charged lipids. 
%I will demonstrate that accounting for electronic polarization 
%is necessary for accurate description of interactions 
%between ions and phospholipids.
