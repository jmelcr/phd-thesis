 cytosol and cytoplasm. Electrolytes in biology, salts, Important cations (anions). 
 K, Na, Ca -- and -- Li, Mg, Zn.
 List all of them, but concentrate only on K, Na and Ca (Cl), as they are the most abundant and they take part in neural singalling and transmembrane potential gradients (Neurons, hear-beat, hearing)
 I can probably take hints from our recent publication on ECC-Ca by \citet{martinek17}. 

 Unequal distribution of cations forms transmembrane potential on cell membranes -- neurons, synaptic bouton (very briefly, it's a motivation here). 

 End up with some statement on how membrane cation interactions are abundant and also relevant in biology.
 Signalling? (i.e. lipids, POPS, and some cations, Ca)
