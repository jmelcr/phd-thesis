It is clear from the above discourse that accounting for electronic polarization is crucial for an accurate response of the lipid electrometer in simulation. 


In conclusion, the results suggest that calcium ions bind specifically to the phosphate oxygens, occasionally interacting also with the carbonyls of the PC lipids. This is in a qualitative agreement with previous conclusions from several experimental studies~\citep{hauser76, hauser78, herbette84, cevc90, binder02}. However, the present results suggest, in 
agreement with experiments, an overally weaker binding to the bilayer, in particular with a lower relative binding affinity to the carbonyls than inferred from previous MD simulation studies~\citep{bockmann03, bockmann04, melcrova16, javanainen17}.
