\section*{Interactions of ions with phospholipid bilayers}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Interactions of ions with phospholipid bilayers}

Cellular membranes are surrounded by 
weak electrolytic solutions of \ce{KCl} on the intracellular side, 
and of \ce{NaCl} on the extracellular side. 
The biological relevance of these ions reaches from relatively simple osmotic effects to the complex processes in neural signalling. \citep{Knudsen_book2002} 
Calcium is an important cation in biology, 
which takes part in many signalling pathways and processes. 

Interactions of cations like \ce{Na^+}, \ce{K^+} and \ce{Ca^{2+}} with cellular membranes 
play a key role in many biological processes. 
Although the binding of these cations to model biological membranes 
has been widely studied both in
experiments and simulations~\citep{catte16, nmrlipids_proj4},
the details of the interactions are, however, not fully consistent in the literature.
%there was no consensus on the binding of 
%\ce{Na^+}, \ce{K^+}, and \ce{Ca^{2+}} cations
%to biological membranes -- 
%simulations and some experiments   \citep{berkowitz12, vacha09a, harb13}
%do not reproduce other experiments \citep{roux90, pabst07, akutsu81}. 
Interpretations of mostly spectroscopic methods, like nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), 
x-ray scattering, and infrared spectroscopy suggest that monovalent alkali cations (with the exception of Li$^+$) 
exhibit negligible binding to PC lipid bilayers, 
while multivalent cations interact more strongly 
\citep{cevc90,tocanne90, hauser76,hauser78,herbette84,altenbach84,uhrikova08}.
In contrast, much stronger interactions between monovalent cations and phospholipids are reported from 
microscopy measurements \citep{harb13,manyes06,fukuma07,ferber11,morata12},
and atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations \citep{cordomi09,valley11,berkowitz12,catte16,nmrlipids_proj4,melcr18}.
My work solves these apparent controversies 
by embedding the electronic polarization into MD simulations,
which is missing in the previous works. 
Accounting for this effect generally improves the accuracy of MD simulations,
and brings them to a \emph{quantitative} agreement 
with the works that predict weaker binding 
in a direct comparison using the concept of lipid electrometer from NMR.

Ion binding in lipid bilayers can be experimentally quantified
by measuring the changes of the head group order parameters in lipids.
In the case of the head group order parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in phosphatidylcholine
(see Fig.~\ref{fig:simVSexpNOions} for the definition of the order parameters)
such changes are known under the term ''electrometer concept'' \citep{seelig87,catte16, ollila16}. 
It is experimentally observed that the C-H bond
order parameters of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ carbons in a PC lipid head group
are proportional to the amount of charge, positive or negative, bound per lipid~\citep{seelig87}.
The change of the order parameters measured with varying concentrations of aqueous ions 
can be then related to the amount of bound ions.


In our publications \citep{catte16, nmrlipids_proj4},
we have shown that such order parameters can be accurately determined also from MD simulations
and their changes correlate with the amount of bound charge in phospholipid bilayers, 
despite the inaccuracies in their actual structures without salts \citep{botan15}. 
It was found, however, that
none of the force fields examined in those works 
provided a sufficient accuracy for interpreting 
the experimentally measured structural changes induced by salt concentrations
and cation-lipid stoichiometries. 
While there were several models
that predicted realistic binding affinities of \ce{Na^+} to PC bilayers,
all existing models overestimated the binding affinity of \ce{Ca^{2+}}
unless ad hoc specific repulsive potentials between the cations and the bilayer were applied. \citep{catte16, nmrlipids_proj4}
Thus,
we identified the strong binding of \ce{Na^+} and \ce{Ca^{2+}} cations
in existing simulation models as a computational artifact.  
Such excessive amounts of cations 
would form effectively positively charged membranes
even at physiological concentrations
affecting interactions with any charged molecules. 
For instance,
the total charge of proteins
in prokaryotes and also eukaryotes 
is mostly negative,
\citep{link1997identifying, link1997comparing, urquhart1998comparison, schwartz2001whole, knight2004global}
Thus,
positively charged membranes would promote non-specific adsorption of proteins on their surface 
contrary to experiment.  
\citep{junkova2016, lingwood2010lipid, sekerevs2015song} 




In our recent work~\citep{catte16}, we addressed the apparent controversies 
using the molecular electrometer concept, 
where the experimentally (by NMR) measured changes of certain head group order parameters 
are related to the amount of charge bound to a bilayer. \citep{brown77,akutsu81,altenbach84,seelig87,scherer89}.
This concept is introduced and further discussed in the following section~\ref{section:electrometer}. 
We have shown that the response of the PC head group order parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ 
to cations bound to the bilayer is qualitatively correct in MD simulations, 
but several models grossly overestimate the affinity of \ce{Na^+} to such bilayers. 
Moreover, we find that the interactions of \ce{Ca^{2+}} cations with PC bilayers
in current simulation models are not accurate enough for interpreting NMR experiments. 
We argued that the lack of electronic polarizability in the simulations 
can be responsible for the disagreement. 
Consequently, we developed a model of POPC, 
which accounts for electronic polarization through electronic continuum correction, 
and which yields accurate response of the head group order parameters to various monovalent and divalent cations. \citep{melcr18}
This model was also extended to other lipids, namely POPE and POPS.
Our work provides a simulation-based supporting evidence to the older view,
which suggests that \ce{Na^+} and \ce{K^+} interact weakly, 
while \ce{Ca^{2+}} specifically binds to phospholipid bilayers.

\todo{Connect with previous: in order to achieve that\ldots}

A major improvement over currently available non-polarizable force fields
was achieved by developing new models of phospholipids, 
the so called ECC-lipids,
which are described in section~\ref{section:ecc-lipids}
and in the publication \citep{melcr18}. 
In contrast to the models studied in the works \citep{catte16, nmrlipids_proj4},
ECC-lipids account for electronic polarization
via the electronic continuum correction,  
which was introduced in section~\ref{section:ecc}. 
In short, 
ECC is an implicit model of electronic polarizability,
which can be straightforwardly implemented into current force fields 
by scaling charges.  
In section~\ref{section:ecc-lipids},
we demonstrated on the cases of PC, PS, and PE phospholipids
that it is sufficient to also scale the Lennard-Jones parameters $\sigma$ of the affected atoms
to reach a structural agreement with x-ray scattering experiments. 
Our new model, ECC-lipids,
provides a proof of concept of the applicability of ECC
to charged as well as neutral molecules. 
 
We compared X-ray scattering form factors and NMR order parameters of bilayers
in pure water without any ions (or only counter ions)
from simulations and experiments
as the first step in the assessment of the quality of the model. 
The experimental X-ray scattering form factors 
of a bilayer are well reproduced for all lipids employing the presented ECC-lipids model 
(see Figs.~\ref{fig:simVSexpNOions}, \ref{simVSexpNOions_POPE} and \ref{simVSexpNOions_POPS}). 

The area per lipid is often used as a relatively simple structural parameter reporting on the bilayer properties and the packing of lipids. 
In experiments, modeling is used on top of the scattering factors to obtain it \citep{kucerka14}. 
From simulations, this property is easily extracted. 
The area per lipid of POPC in simulation with ECC-lipids model is smaller by $\approx 1Å^2$ 
than the experimental value derived from the SDP model \citep{kucerka14}. 
The values of the area per lipid of the ECC-POPC model vary slightly 
when simulated with different water models, however,
they are still close to the experiment. \citep{melcr18}


The head group order parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are highly relevant for this work,
as they are being used in the electrometer concept (introduced in section~\ref{section:electrometer}). 
For POPC in pure water, the order parameter $\beta$ agrees well with the experiment, 
while the order parameter $\alpha$ is somewhat lower. 
In the case of POPS, the situation is a bit more complicated
compared to POPC as the order parameter $\alpha$ exhibits a notable forking (see Fig.~\ref{simVSexpNOions_POPS}).
One of the order parameters of ECC-POPS, $\alpha_1$, agrees well with the experiment, 
while the other, $\alpha_2$, adopts a higher value underestimating the experimentally reported forking. 
There is only one order parameter $\beta$ in POPS, 
which has a higher value closer to zero in the ECC-lipids model than in experiment. 
Such a feature suggests that the model overestimates the orientational freedom of its head group.

%%% Sum up what is to be presented briefly

The changes of the head group order parameters $S^\alpha$ and $S^\beta$ from simulations and experiments 
are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_CaCl} for a neutral POPC bilayer, 
and in Fig.~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_CaCl_PCPS} for a negatively charged bilayer with the composition 5\,PC:1\,PS. 
For a direct comparison and a connection to our works \citep{catte16, nmrlipids_proj4},
we show simulation results from ECC-lipids and also from Lipid17 \citep{lipid17-future}. 
This also highlights the improvements in ECC-lipids over Lipid17 arising from the electronic polarization. 
%Although Lipid17 already belongs to the top-performing models in terms of the responses of the head group order parameters in those studies,  
%including electronic polarizability to form ECC-lipids improves the results even further.
The effect is probably the most striking for POPS, 
for which also the structure of a pure POPS bilayer with only counterions is dramatically improved with the augmentation. 


%%% Discuss the changes of OPs and vectors from neutral and neg. membranes
%While the changes induced by \ce{CaCl2} are \emph{qualitatively} correct for Lipid14/17, 
Increasing concentrations of \ce{CaCl2} induce a systematic decrease of the order parameters $S^\alpha$ and $S^\beta$ in POPC. 
Although the total magnitude of the response of the PC head group order parameters 
is only slightly higher in the negatively charged bilayers than in the neutral bilayers, 
the shape of the changes in the latter shows a steeper onset at low concentrations. 
This is apparently due to the presence of POPS, 
which has a higher affinity to \ce{Ca^{2+}} compared to POPC. 
ECC-lipids is the first model,
which achieves a \emph{quantitative} agreement with the changes induced by \ce{CaCl2} in experiments.

    } 
\end{figure} 
 





%%% Present the density profiles (different concentrations for both POPC and mixed)
The increase in the amount of bound calcium cations from pure POPC to the mixed negatively charged bilayer containing POPS
is well demonstrated using the relative surface excess, $\Gamma ^w _{Ca}$,
summarized in Table~\ref{tab:binding}. 
Distributions of \ce{Ca^{2+}}, \ce{Na^+} counterions and also \ce{Cl^-} 
are plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:cacl-dens} for the neutral POPC bilayer, 
and in Fig.~\ref{fig:cacl-dens_PCPS} for the negatively charged bilayer. 
In contrast to \ce{KCl} or added concentrations of \ce{NaCl}, 
\ce{Na^+} counterions are substituted with \ce{Ca^{2+}} even at low concentrations of \ce{CaCl2}. 
The increasing concentration of \ce{CaCl2} and, hence, a higher amount of bound \ce{Ca^{2+}}
also attracts \ce{Cl^-} anions to the bilayer 
as can be seen from its growing density at the interface. 


%%% discuss the table with Gammas and follow up with molecular details, where do cations bind? Support with the spatial density figure
The density profiles of ions suggest that
the dominant contribution to the binding of \ce{Ca^{2+}} to phospholipid bilayers
comes from the interactions with the phosphate groups in both POPC and POPS. 
%The population analysis also suggests 
%that the calcium cations prefer to reside in the phosphate region of the membrane. 
%Such a finding is further validated with a more detailed analysis using Markov state modeling (MSM) \citep{Pande_MSM_paper} \todoi{Add papers reviewing MSM, e.g. recent Pande's paper.}. 
%The set of states of a calcium cation 
%encompassed all possible combinations of up to three surrounding lipids. 
%In the case of PC, we used only the phosphate moitety, which forms the dominant contribution for calcium binding.
%For PS we also distinguished configurations in which calcium interacts with the carboxylate moiety. 
%All possible combinations of such states were used to build a Markov model at a lag time $25\,\mathrm{ns}$ using pyEMMA code by \citet{pyemma} \todoi{add citation for pyemma}. 
%The resulting MSM was validated using Chapman-Kolmogorov test \citep{FrankNoe_papers_MSM} \todoi{Add citation for Noe's papers on MSM, especially Chapman Kolmogorov test.}. 
%The stationary distribution of the states reveals a strong preference of the calcium cations to reside in the phosphate region of the mixed PC-PS membrane. 
%When interacting with PS, configurations with the phosphate moiety from either PC or PS dominate the population.
%Moreover, states containing interactions with the carboxylate group in PS 
%bear higher probability when interacting also with the phosphate group of the same lipid or other lipids. 
This is also reflected in the shift of the mean orientation 
of the \ce{COO^-} group from $62^\circ$ to $73^\circ$ (420~mM \ce{CaCl2})
which was measured as the connector of the carbon atoms 
forming the bond between the group and the $\beta$-carbon of the phospholipid. 
The interactions of the carboxylate group in PS with calcium and other phosphate groups
shed light into the qualitatively different response of the head group order parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in PS compared to PC 
(see Figs.~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_CaCl} and~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_CaCl_PCPS}). 
We find that the complex response of the head group order parameters of POPS 
is affected by the conformational changes of the carboxylate group,
which is attracted more towards the phosphate region, 
where the calcium cations dominantly bind. 
In line with the experimental work by \citet{browning80},
this is also very likely the reason, 
why the magnitude of the P-N vector change in POPS is diminished compared to POPC, 
which is not restrained by an additional cation binding group like \ce{COO^-} in POPS.

\section*{Modeling of transmembrane potential}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Modeling of transmembrane potential}

The intracellular environment of cells contains a weak electrolytic solution of \ce{KCl}, 
while there is a similarly weak solution of \ce{NaCl} on the extracellular side. 
The concentrations of these salts, usually around 150\,mM, 
are regulated and maintained out of equilibrium through specific channels and pumps 
to provide cellular functions and general homeostasis conditions \citep{Bezanilla2008, Knudsen_book2002}. 
The unequal distribution of ions on either side of the membrane
gives rise to a transmembrane potential. 
For instance, the concerted action of voltage-gated ion channels and pumps in neurons 
modulates their transmembrane potential
providing a fast signal transduction through the axons \citep{Knudsen_book2002, Storace2015, Sung2015}. 
The common magnitude of the transmembrane potential in cells is in the range of 10--100~mV. 
In experiment, the membrane potential can be measured using the patch clamp technique \citep{Bezanilla2008}
and the more modern voltage-sensitive fluorescent probes \citep{Storace2015, Sung2015}. 

The transmembrane potential in simulations can be modeled by several methods. \citep{Tieleman2001,Sin2015, Roux1997, sachs04_potential}.
In particular, 
there are two approaches for the modeling of 
the membrane potential in atomistic molecular dynamics simulations --
 the constant electric field method \citep{Roux1997,Roux2008,gumbart_constant_2012}, 
and
 the ion-imbalance method \citep{sachs04_potential,Delemotte2008}. 
Both of these methods have been successfully used to study membrane electroporation or voltage-sensitive proteins \citep{Vargas2012, bockmann_kinetics_2008, gumbart_constant_2012, kutzner_computational_2011, casciola_molecular_2014}. 
These two practically independent developments were compared and connected together in our work \citep{melcr16},
where we prove them to be equivalent models of the transmembrane potential yielding indistinguishable results, 
at least for electrolytes formed by the same monovalent ions on both sides of the membrane. 
We used simulations 
in which we simultaneously applied both methods
with the same magnitude but opposite polarity 
yielding zero transmembrane voltage in total 
to highlight possible artifacts. 
The comparison in Fig.~\ref{fig:potentialKCl} shows 
that such a setup is indistinguishable 
from simulations without voltage within the achievable accuracy. 
The electric field induced by the voltage 
exists exclusively in the hydrophobic region of the membrane,
where it has an almost constant strength. 
This finding provides clues to understanding the evolutionary design of voltage-gated proteins. \citep{Vargas2012} 
Moreover,
the structure of the bilayer is preserved even at high voltages at the time scales of our simulations,
unlike that of water at the interface with the hydrophobic core of the bilayer
underlining its importance in electroporation. \citep{bu2017mechanics}

 \caption{The transmembrane potential (A,B), the electric field intensity (C,D), and the charge density (E,F) profiles for simulations of a POPC bilayer with 150\,mM concentration of \ce{KCl}. 
ZERO stands for simulations without any applied voltage,
IIMB stands for the ion imbalance method,
CEF  stands for the constant electric field method,
and FxI denotes the special setup, in which the two methods are applied simultaneously. 
The gray area shows the standard error. 
The voltage drop across the membrane is $499\,$mV for IIMB and $486\,$mV for CEF with the error of about $7\,$mV.
