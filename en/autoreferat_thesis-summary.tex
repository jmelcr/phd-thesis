\section*{Interactions of ions with phospholipid bilayers}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Interactions of ions with phospholipid bilayers}

Cellular membranes are surrounded by 
weak electrolytic solutions of \ce{KCl} on the intracellular side, 
and of \ce{NaCl} on the extracellular side. 
The biological relevance of these ions reaches from relatively simple osmotic effects to the complex processes in neural signalling. \citep{Knudsen_book2002} 
Calcium is an important cation in biology, 
which takes part in many signalling pathways and processes. 

Interactions of cations like \ce{Na^+}, \ce{K^+} and \ce{Ca^{2+}} with cellular membranes 
play a key role in many biological processes. 
Although the binding of these cations to model biological membranes 
has been widely studied both in
experiments and simulations~\citep{catte16, nmrlipids_proj4},
the details of the interactions are, however, not fully consistent in the literature.
%there was no consensus on the binding of 
%\ce{Na^+}, \ce{K^+}, and \ce{Ca^{2+}} cations
%to biological membranes -- 
%simulations and some experiments   \citep{berkowitz12, vacha09a, harb13}
%do not reproduce other experiments \citep{roux90, pabst07, akutsu81}. 
Interpretations of mostly spectroscopic methods, like nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), 
x-ray scattering, and infrared spectroscopy suggest that monovalent alkali cations (with the exception of Li$^+$) 
exhibit negligible binding to PC lipid bilayers, 
while multivalent cations interact more strongly 
\citep{cevc90,tocanne90, hauser76,hauser78,herbette84,altenbach84,uhrikova08}.
In contrast, much stronger interactions between monovalent cations and phospholipids are reported from 
microscopy measurements \citep{harb13,manyes06,fukuma07,ferber11,morata12},
and atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations \citep{cordomi09,valley11,berkowitz12,catte16,nmrlipids_proj4,melcr18}.
My work solves this controversy
by introducing a fundamental physics-based improvement into MD simulations
making them for the first time \emph{quantitatively} agreeing with the works predicting the weaker binding.

Ion binding to lipid bilayers can be experimentally quantified
by measuring the changes of the head group order parameters in the lipids using solid state NMR.
In the case of the head group order parameters $S^\alpha$ and $S^\beta$ in phosphatidylcholine
(see Fig.~\ref{fig:simVSexpNOions} for the definition of the order parameters)
such changes are known under the term ''electrometer concept'' \citep{seelig87,catte16, ollila16}. 
It is experimentally observed that the C-H bond
order parameters of $S^\alpha$ and $S^\beta$ carbons in a PC lipid head group
are proportional to the amount of charge, positive or negative, bound per lipid~\citep{seelig87}.
The change of the order parameters measured with varying concentrations of aqueous ions 
can be then related to the amount of bound ions.


In our publications \citep{catte16, nmrlipids_proj4},
we have shown that such order parameters can be accurately determined also from MD simulations
and their changes correlate with the amount of bound charge in phospholipid bilayers, 
despite the inaccuracies in their actual structures without salts \citep{botan15}. 
It was found, however, that
none of the force fields examined in those works 
provided a sufficient accuracy for interpreting 
the experimentally measured structural changes induced by salt concentrations
and cation-lipid stoichiometries. 


A major improvement over currently available non-polarizable force fields
was achieved by developing new models of phospholipids, 
the so called ECC-lipids.
We developed models of POPC, POPE and POPS lipids,
which account for electronic polarization through electronic continuum correction (ECC), 
and which yield accurate response of the head group order parameters to various monovalent and divalent cations. \citep{melcr18}
In short, 
ECC is an implicit model of electronic polarizability,
which can be straightforwardly implemented into current force fields 
by scaling charges. 
Moreover, simulations with ECC-lipids, an \emph{implicitly polarizable} force field, come 
without any extra computational costs compared to standard fixed-charge simulations. 
Our new model, ECC-lipids,
provides a proof of concept of the applicability of ECC
to charged as well as neutral molecules. 

We compared X-ray scattering form factors and NMR order parameters of bilayers
in pure water without any ions (or only counterions)
from simulations and experiments
as the first step in the assessment of the quality of the model. 
The experimental X-ray scattering form factors 
of a bilayer are well reproduced for all lipids employing the presented ECC-lipids model, 
as shown in~Fig.~\ref{fig:simVSexpNOions} for POPC. 
The head group order parameters $S^\alpha$ and $S^\beta$ are highly relevant for this work,
as they are being used in the lipid electrometer concept. 
For POPC in pure water, the order parameter $S^\beta$ agrees well with the experiment, 
while the order parameter $S^\alpha$ is somewhat lower.

%%% Sum up what is to be presented briefly

The changes of the head group order parameters $S^\alpha$ and $S^\beta$ from simulations and experiments 
are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_CaCl} for a neutral POPC bilayer, 
and in Figs.~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_CaCl_PCPS} and \ref{fig:delta_ordPar_CaCl_PCPS2} for a negatively charged bilayer with the composition 5\,PC:1\,PS. 
For a direct comparison and a connection to our works \citep{catte16, nmrlipids_proj4},
we show simulation results from ECC-lipids and also from Lipid17, a standard non-polarizable fixed-charge force field \citep{lipid17-future}. 
This also highlights the improvements in ECC-lipids over Lipid17 arising from the electronic polarization. 
%Although Lipid17 already belongs to the top-performing models in terms of the responses of the head group order parameters in those studies,  
%including electronic polarizability to form ECC-lipids improves the results even further.
The effect is probably the most striking for POPS, 
for which also the structure of a pure POPS bilayer with only counterions is dramatically improved with the augmentation. 


%%% Discuss the changes of OPs and vectors from neutral and neg. membranes
%While the changes induced by \ce{CaCl2} are \emph{qualitatively} correct for Lipid14/17, 
Increasing concentrations of \ce{CaCl2} induce a systematic decrease of the order parameters $S^\alpha$ and $S^\beta$ in POPC. 
Although the total magnitude of the response of the PC head group order parameters 
is only slightly higher in the negatively charged bilayers than in the neutral bilayers, 
the shape of the changes in the latter shows a steeper onset at low concentrations. 
This is apparently due to the presence of POPS, 
which has a higher affinity to \ce{Ca^{2+}} compared to POPC. 
ECC-lipids is the first model,
which achieves a \emph{quantitative} agreement with the changes induced by \ce{CaCl2} in experiments.

%%% Present the density profiles (different concentrations for both POPC and mixed)
The increase in the amount of bound calcium cations from pure POPC to the mixed negatively charged bilayer containing POPS
is well demonstrated using the relative surface excess, $\Gamma ^w _{Ca}$.
Distributions of \ce{Ca^{2+}}, \ce{Na^+} counterions and also \ce{Cl^-} 
are plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:cacl-dens} for the neutral POPC bilayer, 
and in Fig.~\ref{fig:cacl-dens_PCPS} for the negatively charged bilayer. 
The increasing concentration of \ce{CaCl2} and, hence, a higher amount of bound \ce{Ca^{2+}}
attracts \ce{Cl^-} anions to the bilayer 
as can be seen from its growing density at the interface. 
%%% discuss the table with Gammas and follow up with molecular details, where do cations bind? Support with the spatial density figure
The density profiles of ions suggest that
the dominant contribution to the binding of \ce{Ca^{2+}} to phospholipid bilayers
comes from the interactions with the phosphate groups in both POPC and POPS. 
%The population analysis also suggests 
%that the calcium cations prefer to reside in the phosphate region of the membrane. 
%Such a finding is further validated with a more detailed analysis using Markov state modeling (MSM) \citep{Pande_MSM_paper} \todoi{Add papers reviewing MSM, e.g. recent Pande's paper.}. 
%The set of states of a calcium cation 
%encompassed all possible combinations of up to three surrounding lipids. 
%In the case of PC, we used only the phosphate moitety, which forms the dominant contribution for calcium binding.
%For PS we also distinguished configurations in which calcium interacts with the carboxylate moiety. 
%All possible combinations of such states were used to build a Markov model at a lag time $25\,\mathrm{ns}$ using pyEMMA code by \citet{pyemma} \todoi{add citation for pyemma}. 
%The resulting MSM was validated using Chapman-Kolmogorov test \citep{FrankNoe_papers_MSM} \todoi{Add citation for Noe's papers on MSM, especially Chapman Kolmogorov test.}. 
%The stationary distribution of the states reveals a strong preference of the calcium cations to reside in the phosphate region of the mixed PC-PS membrane. 
%When interacting with PS, configurations with the phosphate moiety from either PC or PS dominate the population.
%Moreover, states containing interactions with the carboxylate group in PS 
%bear higher probability when interacting also with the phosphate group of the same lipid or other lipids. 
This is also reflected in the shift of the mean orientation 
of the \ce{COO^-} group from $62^\circ$ to $73^\circ$ (420~mM \ce{CaCl2})
which was measured as the connector of the carbon atoms 
forming the bond between the group and the $\beta$-carbon of the phospholipid. 
The interactions of the carboxylate group in PS with calcium and other phosphate groups
shed light into the qualitatively different response of the head group order parameters $S^\alpha$ and $S^\beta$ in PS compared to PC 
(see Figs.~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_CaCl} and~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_CaCl_PCPS}). 
We find that the complex response of the head group order parameters of POPS 
is affected by the conformational changes of the carboxylate group,
which is attracted more towards the phosphate region, 
where the calcium cations dominantly bind. 
In line with the experimental work by \citet{browning80},
this is also very likely the reason, 
why the magnitude of the P-N vector change in POPS is diminished compared to POPC, 
which is not restrained by an additional cation binding group like \ce{COO^-} in POPS. 


In summary,
treatment  of the electronic polarization 
was shown to have a dramatically positive impact on the accuracy of the description of interactions
between phospholipids and cations. 
The presented application of ECC to lipids
constitutes a pivotal work for its future adaptations 
to also other compounds, especially charged and zwitterionic, 
e.g., proteins or nucleic acids,
for which we expect improvements in computational description in a similar range.

\section*{Modeling of transmembrane potential}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Modeling of transmembrane potential}

The intracellular environment of cells contains a weak electrolytic solution of \ce{KCl}, 
while there is a similarly weak solution of \ce{NaCl} on the extracellular side. 
The concentrations of these salts, usually around 150\,mM, 
are regulated and maintained out of equilibrium through specific channels and pumps 
to provide cellular functions and general homeostasis conditions \citep{Bezanilla2008, Knudsen_book2002}. 
The unequal distribution of ions on either side of the membrane
gives rise to a transmembrane potential. 
For instance, the concerted action of voltage-gated ion channels and pumps in neurons 
modulates their transmembrane potential
providing a fast signal transduction through the axons \citep{Knudsen_book2002, Storace2015, Sung2015}. 
A common magnitude of the transmembrane potential in cells is in the range of 10--100~mV. 

The transmembrane potential in simulations can be modeled by several methods. \citep{Tieleman2001,Sin2015, Roux1997, sachs04_potential}.
In particular, 
there are two approaches for the modeling of 
the membrane potential in atomistic molecular dynamics simulations --
 the constant electric field method \citep{Roux1997,Roux2008,gumbart_constant_2012}, 
and
 the ion-imbalance method \citep{sachs04_potential,Delemotte2008}. 
Both of these methods have been successfully used to study membrane electroporation or voltage-sensitive proteins \citep{Vargas2012, bockmann_kinetics_2008, gumbart_constant_2012, kutzner_computational_2011, casciola_molecular_2014}. 
These two practically independent developments were compared and connected together in our work \citep{melcr16},
where we prove them to be equivalent models of the transmembrane potential yielding indistinguishable results, 
at least for electrolytes formed by the same monovalent ions on both sides of the membrane. 
We used simulations 
in which we simultaneously applied both methods
with the same magnitude but opposite polarity 
yielding zero transmembrane voltage in total 
to highlight possible artifacts. 
The comparison in Fig.~\ref{fig:potentialKCl} shows 
that such a setup is indistinguishable 
from simulations without voltage within the achievable accuracy. 
The electric field induced by the voltage 
exists exclusively in the hydrophobic region of the membrane,
where it has an almost constant strength. 
This finding provides clues to understanding the evolutionary design of voltage-gated proteins. \citep{Vargas2012} 
Moreover,
the structure of the bilayer is preserved even at high voltages at the time scales of our simulations,
unlike that of water at the interface with the hydrophobic core of the bilayer
underlining its importance in electroporation. \citep{bu2017mechanics}
