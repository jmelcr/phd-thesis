 Interaction with cations -- significance. 

 What is known in this respect. 

 Contradiction between simulation/experimental studies 
(use what's in the paper PCCP NMRLipids II). 

Experimental studies.

\section{Electrometer concept}

\section{SAXS? + other techniques (just to make the lit. research complete) -- probably not.}
