All living cells separate their inner environment by a membrane. 
preventing molecules from a free diffusion in or out. 
This allows them to maintain specific conditions required for their functioning. 
Cellular membranes are mainly composed of lipids and proteins. 
Depending on its function, the membrane can be enriched with other molecules, e.g. sugars and saccharides forming glycocalyx \citep{reitsma07}. 
In such a dynamically structured fluid mosaic,  % dynamically structured mosaic model
lipids self-assemble into a lipid bilayer \citep{vereb03,Mouritsen2011,Vattulainen2011}.

The intracellular environment contains a weak electrolytic solution of \ce{KCl} 
while there is a similarly weak solution of \ce{NaCl} on the extracellular side. 
The concentrations of these salts, usually around 150\,mM, 
are regulated and maintained out of equilibrium through specific channels and pumps 
to provide specific functions and stress-free conditions \citep{Bezanilla2008, Knudsen_book2002}. 

Transmembrane potential is a crucial property of living cells.  
affecting distributions of ions and protons as well as their currents through the membrane. 
For example, the concerted action of voltage-gated channels and pumps in neurons 
provides the fast signal transduction through axons \citep{Knudsen_book2002, Storace2015, Sung2015}. 
The common magnitude of the transmembrane potential in cells is in the range 10--100~mV. 
In experiment, the membrane potential can be measured using the patch clamp technique \citep{Bezanilla2008}
and the current in-development voltage-sensitive fluorescent probes \citep{Storace2015, Sung2015}. 

The transmembrane potential in simulations can be modeled by various methods. \citep{Roux1997,Tieleman2001,Sin2015, Roux2008,Gumbart2012, Sachs2004,Delemotte2008}.
In particular for particle-based molecular simulations, 
there are two methods for the modelling of the membrane potential --
 the constant electric field method \citep{Roux1997,Roux2008,Gumbart2012} and
 the ion-imbalance method \citep{Sachs2004,Delemotte2008}. 
Both of these methods have been successfully used to study membrane electroporation or voltage-sensitive proteins \cite{Vargas2012, bockmann_kinetics_2008, gumbart_constant_2012, kutzner_computational_2011, casciola_molecular_2014}. 
We have compared and connected together the two practically independent developments in our work \citep{melcr16}
proving that they are equivalent models of the transmembrane potential yielding indistinguishable results.

Due to its high physiological importance --- nerve cell signalling being the prime example ---
interaction of cations with phospholipid membranes
has been widely studied via theory, simulations, and experiments.
The relative ion binding affinities are generally agreed to
follow the Hofmeister series~\citep{eisenberg79,cevc90,tocanne90,binder02,celma07,leontidis09,vacha09a,klasczyk10,harb13}, 
however,
consensus on the quantitative affinities is currently lacking.
Until 1990, the consensus (documented in two extensive reviews~\citep{cevc90,tocanne90}) was that
while  multivalent cations interact significantly with phospholipid bilayers,
for monovalent cations (with the exception of Li$^+$) the interactions are weak.
This conclusion has since been strengthened by further
studies showing that bilayer properties remain unaltered upon the addition of sub-molar concentrations of monovalent 
salt~\citep{binder02,pabst07,filippov09}.
Since 2000, however, another view has emerged, suggesting much stronger interactions between phospholipids and monovalent cations, and strong Na$^{+}$ binding in particular~\citep{bockmann03,bockmann04,vacha09a,manyes05,manyes06,fukuma07,leontidis09,ferber11,morata12,klasczyk10,harb13}.

The pre-2000 view has the experimental support that
(in contrast to the significant effects caused by any multivalent cations)
sub-molar concentrations of NaCl have a negligible effect on
phospholipid infrared spectra~\citep{binder02},
area per molecule~\citep{pabst07},
dipole potential~\citep{clarke99},
lateral diffusion~\citep{filippov09},
and choline head group order parameters~\citep{akutsu81};
in addition, the water sorption isotherm of a NaCl--phospholipid system
is highly similar to that of a  pure NaCl solution
--- indicating that the ion--lipid interaction is very weak~\citep{binder02}. 

The post-2000 'strong binding' view rests on experimental and above all simulational findings.
At sub-molar NaCl concentrations, the rotational and translational dynamics of membrane-embedded fluorescent probes decreased~\citep{bockmann03,vacha09a,harb13}, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments showed changes in bilayer hardness~\citep{manyes05,manyes06,fukuma07,ferber11,morata12};
in atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, phospholipid bilayers consistently bound Na${^+}$,
although the binding strength depended on the model used~\citep{bockmann03,bockmann04,sachs04,berkowitz06,cordomi08,cordomi09,valley11,berkowitz12}.

Some observables have been interpreted in favour of both views. For example,
as the effect of monovalent ions (except Li$^+$)  on the phase transition temperature is tiny
(compared to the effect of multivalent ions), it was initially interpreted 
as an indication that only multivalent ions and Li$^+$ specifically bind to phospholipid bilayers~\citep{cevc90}; 
however, such a small effect in calorimetric measurements was later interpreted to indicate that also
Na$^+$ binds~\citep{bockmann03,klasczyk10}.
Similarly, the lack of significant positive electrophoretic mobility
of phosphatidylcholine (PC) vesicles in the presence of NaCl
(again in contrast to multivalent ions and Li$^+$)
suggested weak binding of Na$^+$~\citep{eisenberg79,tatulian87,manyes05,manyes06,klasczyk10};
%NaCl increases the (initially negative) zeta potential to only about zero,
%whereas positive zeta potentials are generally reached with
however, these data were also explained by a countering effect of the Cl$^-$ ions~\citep{berkowitz06,knecht13}.
Furthermore, to reduce the area per lipid in scattering experiments, molar concentrations of NaCl were required~\citep{pabst07}, indicating weak ion--lipid interaction;
in MD simulations, however, already orders of magnitude lower concentrations resulted in Na$^+$ binding and a clear reduction of area per lipid~\citep{bockmann03,cordomi08}.
Finally, lipid lateral diffusion was unaltered by NaCl in noninvasive NMR experiments~\citep{filippov09};
%suggesting that the fluorescence results arise from Na$^{+}$ interactions with probes rather than with lipids.
%This is pointed out in Conclusions, which I think is the best place for it. -markus.
however, as it was reduced upon Na$^+$ binding in simulations,
the reduced lateral diffusion of fluorescent probes~\citep{bockmann03,vacha09a,harb13}
has been interpreted to support the post-2000 'strong binding' view.

In this paper, we set out to solve the apparent contradictions
between the pre-2000 and post-2000 views.
To this end, we employ the 'molecular electrometer' concept,
according to which the changes in the C--H order parameters of the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ carbons 
in the phospholipid head group (see Fig.~\ref{POPCstructure}) can be used to measure the ion affinity for a
PC lipid bilayer~\citep{brown77,akutsu81,altenbach84,seelig87,scherer89}.
As the order parameters can be accurately measured in experiments and directly compared to 
simulations~\citep{ollila16}, applying the molecular electrometer as a function of cation concentration allows the 
comparison of binding affinity between simulations and experiments.
In addition to demonstrating the usefulness of this general concept,
we show that the response of the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ order parameters to penetrating cations
is qualitatively correct in MD simulations, but that in several  models the affinity of Na$^{+}$ for PC bilayers
is grossly overestimated.
Moreover, we show that the accuracy of lipid--Ca$^{2+}$ interactions 
in current models is not enough for atomistic resolution interpretation of NMR experiments. 



\subsection{NMR molecular electrometer concept} \label{section:electrometer} 

Ion binding in lipid bilayers can be experimentally quantified
by measuring the changes of the head group order parameters in lipids.
In the case of the head group order parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in phosphatidylcholine
(see Fig.~\ref{simVSexpNOions} for the definition of the order parameters)
such changes are known under the term ''electrometer concept'' \citet{seelig87,catte16}. 
It is experimentally observed that the C-H bond
order parameters of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ carbons in a PC lipid head group
are proportional to the amount of charge, positive or negative, bound per lipid~\citep{seelig87}.
The change of the order parameters measured with varying concentrations of aqueous ions 
can be then related to the amount of bound ions.

Our previous publications \citep{catte16,ollila16} demostrate that
the order parameters can be robustly and accurately determined from both MD simulations and  NMR experiments, 
Hence, the electrometer concept can be used to compare the two techniques
in terms of the ion binding affinity to lipid bilayers containing PC phospholipid. 

From MD simulations the order parameters can be calculated using the definition
\begin{equation}\label{OP} 
S_{\rm CH}=\frac{1}{2}\langle 3\cos^2\theta -1 \rangle, 
\end{equation} 
where $\theta$ is the angle between the bond and membrane
normal and the average, denoted with pointed brackets, is taken over all sampled configurations \citep{ollila16}.

The order parameters for all C-H bonds in lipid molecules, including
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ segments in head group, can be accurately measured
using $^2$H NMR or $^{13}$C NMR techniques \citep{ollila16}. 
The relation between the amount of the bound charge per lipid,  $X^\pm$, and
the head group order parameter change, $\Delta S_{\rm{CH}}^{i}$,
is empirically quantified as~\citep{seelig87,ferreira16}

\begin{equation}\label{OPchangeEQ} 
\Delta S_{\rm{CH}}^{i}= S_{\rm{CH}}^{i}(X^\pm)-S_{\rm{CH}}^{i}(0) \approx m_i \frac{4 }{3\chi}X^\pm, 
\end{equation} 
where $S_{\rm{CH}}^{i}(0)$ denote the order parameter in the absence of bound charge,
$i$ refers to either $\alpha$ or $\beta$ carbon,
$m_i$ is an empirical constant depending on the valency and the position of the bound charge,
and $\chi \approx$\,167\,kHz is the quadrupole coupling constant, 
with the experimental value for POPC from the works by \citet{seelig77,Davis83}.

The measured change of the order parameter depends on the head group response to the bound charge 
and on the amount of the bound charge (\textit{i.e.,} $m_i$ and $X^\pm$ in Eq.~\ref{OPchangeEQ}, respectively).  
The quantification of the empirical factor $m_i$ has been done experimentally for a wide range of systems
to show the robustness of the electrometer concept and its negligable chemical specificity~\citep{seelig87, beschiasvili91}. 
The measurements of the electrometer response to cationic surfactants 
can be leveraged in simulations to compare the response of the head group order parameters 
with a known amount of bound surface charge,
as all molecules of the surfactant partition into the bilayer.
